    "# DB2 Jupyter Notebook Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is imported as a Jupyter notebook extension in any notebooks you create with DB2 code in it. Place the following line of code in any notebook that you want to use these commands with:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "&#37;run db2.ipynb\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "This code defines a Jupyter/Python magic command called %sql which allows you to execute DB2 specific calls to \n",
    "the database. There are other packages available for manipulating databases, but this one has been specifically\n",
    "designed for demonstrating a number of the SQL features available in DB2.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of executing the %sql command. A single line SQL statement would use the\n",
    "line format of the magic command:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%sql SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "If you have a large block of sql then you would place the %%sql command at the beginning of the block and then\n",
    "place the SQL statements into the remainder of the block. Using this form of the %%sql statement means that the\n",
    "notebook cell can only contain SQL and no other statements.\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%%sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "ORDER BY LASTNAME\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "You can have multiple lines in the SQL block (%%sql). The default SQL delimiter is the semi-column (;).\n",
    "If you have scripts (triggers, procedures, functions) that use the semi-colon as part of the script, you \n",
    "will need to use the -d option to change the delimiter to an at \"@\" sign. \n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%%sql -d\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE\n",
    "@\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE ...\n",
    "@\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The %sql command allows most DB2 commands to execute and has a special version of the CONNECT statement. \n",
    "A CONNECT by itself will attempt to reconnect to the database using previously used settings. If it cannot \n",
    "connect, it will prompt the user for additional information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CONNECT command has the following format:\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "%sql CONNECT TO &lt;database&gt; USER &lt;userid&gt; USING &lt;password | ?&gt; HOST &lt;ip address&gt; PORT &lt;port number&gt;\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "If you use a \"?\" for the password field, the system will prompt you for a password. This avoids typing the \n",
    "password as clear text on the screen. If a connection is not successful, the system will print the error\n",
    "message associated with the connect request.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the connection is successful, the parameters are saved on your system and will be used the next time you\n",
    "run a SQL statement, or when you issue the %sql CONNECT command with no parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the -d option, there are a number different options that you can specify at the beginning of \n",
    "the SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- -d - Delimiter: Change SQL delimiter to \"@\" from \";\"\n",
    "- -q - Quiet: Quiet results - no answer set or messages returned from the function\n",
    "- -r - Return the result set as an array of values instead of a dataframe\n",
    "- -t - Time: Time the following SQL statement and return the number of times it executes in 1 second\n",
    "- -j - JSON: Create a pretty JSON representation. Only the first column is formatted\n",
    "- -a - All: Return all rows in answer set and do not limit display\n",
    "- -pb - Plot Bar: Plot the results as a bar chart\n",
    "- -pl - Plot Line: Plot the results as a line chart\n",
    "- -pp - Plot Pie: Plot the results as a pie chart\n",
    "- -i - Interactive plot mode\n",
    "- -sampledata - Create and load the EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT tables\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "You can pass python variables to the %sql command by using the {} braces with the name of the\n",
    "variable inbetween. Note that you will need to place proper punctuation around the variable in the event the\n",
    "SQL command requires it. For instance, the following example will find employee '000010' in the EMPLOYEE table.\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "empno = '000010'\n",
    "%sql SELECT LASTNAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE EMPNO='{empno}'\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option is to use parameter markers. What you would need to do is use the name of the variable with a colon in front of it and the program will prepare the statement and then pass the variable to Db2 when the statement is executed. This allows you to create complex strings that might contain quote characters and other special characters and not have to worry about enclosing the string with the correct quotes. Note that you do not place the quotes around the variable even though it is a string.\n",
